# Twitter OAuth Tweet Sender

This Node.js package provides a simple command-line tool for sending tweets to Twitter using OAuth 1.0a authentication. It uses the `oauth-1.0a` library for OAuth authorization and the `crypto` library for cryptographic functions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code file.

2. Install the required Node.js modules:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your Twitter API credentials by creating a `.env` file in the project directory and adding the following information:

   ```plaintext
   CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
   CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
   ```

   Replace `your_consumer_key` and `your_consumer_secret` with your actual Twitter API credentials.

## Usage

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Run the application:

   ```shell
   node tweet_sender.js
   ```

2. The application will guide you through the OAuth authentication process, including authorizing the application and entering a PIN provided by Twitter.

3. Once authenticated, you can enter the text of your tweet, and the application will send the tweet to your Twitter account.
